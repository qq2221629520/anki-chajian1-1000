The latest version of this add-on only works with Anki 2.1.20 or newer.

This add-on allows you to quickly open other cards or notes in a new window:

When you add <code>cidd1234567890123</code> (card id) or <code>nidd1234567890123</code> (note id) to a card or template this add-ons transforms the text in the reviewer/previewer to a clickable hyperlink to open them in a new window.

When you select <code>cidd1234567890123</code>, <code>1234567890123</code>, etc. you have also entries in the context menu to open the new window. 

This add-on also adds an entry to the browser table context menu to copy the card id (cid) or note id (nid).

You can adjust the config of this add-on.

Use this at your own risk.

<b># Compatibility, Limitations</b>
- the hyperlink features does not work with editable fields created by the addons  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1020366288" rel="nofollow">Edit Field During Review</a> or <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438" rel="nofollow">Edit Field During Review (Cloze)</a>. Use the context menu. 
- does not work on the "IR3" note type from the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/935264945" rel="nofollow">Incremental Reading v4.10.3</a>. On this note type there are no clickable hyperlinks. At least you can link to such cards. Use the context menu. 

<b># mobile, ankimobile, ankidroid, ankiweb</b>
Add-ons only work on Windows, Mac, Linux. So on mobile you need a different solution. I use an Android phone and Ankidroid. I added some javascript to my back template that attaches all linked cards/notes at the bottom of my note on mobile, see 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijgnd/anki__preview_card_edit_note_in_extra_window_linked_from_reviewer/master/src/template_back_with_iframe_for_ankidroid.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>

The review view (webview) can't access your database. It can only read media from your collection.media folder. This add-on adds an option to the main menu to export all linked cards/notes to the media folder so that my js function can read them from there. 

This solution for Ankidroid uses iframes and won't work on ankiweb and probably doesn't work on ankimobile. You would have to adjust the solution your back template for these platforms and who knows how well this will work in the long run ...

<b># bugs etc.</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/41524-preview-cardedit-note-in-extra-window-official-thread" rel="nofollow">in the official anki support forum</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__preview_card_edit_note_in_extra_window_linked_from_reviewer/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord). Maybe I'll have an idea ...
